<h3 id="security-challenges">Security Challenges</h3>
<p>The widespread deployment of LLMs has introduced significant security
challenges:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><strong>Misinformation Generation</strong>: LLMs frequently generate
incorrect or hallucinated outputs due to inherent limitations in
training data or contextual misunderstandings</li>

adversarial attacks including prompt injection and jailbreaking</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="detecting-hallucination">2. Detecting Hallucination</h2>
<h3 id="root-causes-of-hallucination">Root Causes of Hallucination</h3>
<p>LLMs hallucinate because they: - Rely on statistical patterns within
word embeddings rather than true cognitive processes - Predict the next
most likely word based on training data patterns without understanding
factual accuracy - Generate coherent-sounding but false information when
lacking sufficient factual context</p>
<h3 id="multimodal-hallucination-causes">Multimodal Hallucination
Causes</h3>
<p><strong>Data-Related Issues:</strong> - Insufficient or noisy data -
Statistical biases leading to misalignment between visual and textual
inputs</p>
<p><strong>Model-Related Issues:</strong> - Weak vision models -
Over-reliance on language knowledge - Poor cross-modal interfaces
hindering accurate information integration</p>
<p><strong>Training-Related Issues:</strong> - Ineffective loss
functions - Absence of human feedback</p>
<p><strong>Inference-Related Issues:</strong> - Loss of visual focus
during generation</p>

<h3 id="bias-mitigation-strategies">3.1 Bias Mitigation Strategies</h3>
<h4 id="pre-processing-stage">Pre-Processing Stage</h4>
<p><strong>Data Augmentation:</strong> - <strong>Counterfactual Data
Augmentation (CDA)</strong>: Balances datasets by substituting
attributes related to gender, race, or protected groups -
<strong>Counterfactual Data Substitution (CDS)</strong>: Improved CDA
approach randomly replacing attributes to mitigate bias</p>
<p><strong>Prompt Tuning:</strong> - Encourages neutral or less
stereotypical outputs by adjusting input prompts - <strong>Hard
Prompts</strong>: Use static templates - <strong>Soft Prompts</strong>:
Generate embeddings dynamically during model interactions</p>
<h4 id="in-training-stage">In-Training Stage</h4>
<p><strong>Iterative Null Space Projection (INLP):</strong> - Removes
bias by projecting targeted attributes into spaces where they donâ€™t
influence outputs</p>
<p><strong>Causal Regularization:</strong> - Ensures models rely on
meaningful, causal relationships rather than biased correlations</p>
<p><strong>Auxiliary Modules:</strong> - <strong>Adapter-based Debiasing
(ADELE)</strong>: Uses additional modules to address bias without
retraining entire model - <strong>GEnder Equality Prompt
(GEEP)</strong>: Overcomes catastrophic forgetting, improves gender
fairness by freezing pre-trained model and learning gender-related
prompts with gender-neutral data</p>
<h4 id="intra-processing-stage">Intra-Processing Stage</h4>
<p><strong>Model Editing:</strong> - Enables targeted updates to model
behavior - Corrects biases in specific areas without affecting overall
performance</p>
<p><strong>Decoding Modification:</strong> - <strong>DEXPERTS</strong>:
Directly affects text generation by adjusting token probabilities - Uses
two models: one promoting non-toxic text, another discouraging harmful
content</p>
<h4 id="post-processing-stage">Post-Processing Stage</h4>
<p><strong>Chain-of-Thought (CoT) Prompting:</strong> - Guides models
through logical reasoning steps - Ensures unbiased response generation -
Reduces biases in gender and occupation-related tasks</p>
<p><strong>Rewriting:</strong> - Detects and replaces biased outputs
with neutral language - Reduces content bias after generation</p>
<h2 id="detecting-llm-generated-content">4. Detecting LLM-Generated
Content</h2>
<p>The proliferation of LLMs blurs the line between human-written and
AI-generated content, raising concerns about information integrity.
Detection methods fall into three broad categories:</p>
<h3 id="metric-based-approaches">4.1 Metric-Based Approaches</h3>
<p>These methods detect AI-generated text based on inherent statistical
properties of LLM outputs, relying on distributional features within the
modelâ€™s probability space.</p>
<p><strong>DetectGPT:</strong> - Proposed by Mitchell et al. - Exploits
negative curvature in probability space of generated text - Provides
zero-shot detection mechanism - <strong>Limitation</strong>:
Effectiveness remains limited</p>
<p><strong>Intrinsic Dimensionality:</strong> - Measures complexity of
text to detect LLM-generated content - Human-written content typically
exhibits higher dimensionality due to diversity and creativity</p>
<h3 id="model-based-approaches">4.2 Model-Based Approaches</h3>
<p>Utilize supervised learning to identify AI-generated text through
classifiers trained on labeled datasets from both AI-generated and
human-generated categories.</p>
<p><strong>Major Issues:</strong> - <strong>Generalization
Problems</strong>: Classifiers fail with new LLM architectures or
unfamiliar domains - <strong>Manipulation Vulnerability</strong>: Poor
performance with paraphrasing and manual editing - <strong>Bias
Issues</strong>: Disproportionately flag text from non-native speakers
as machine-generated</p>
<h3 id="watermarking-and-embedded-signal-approaches">4.3 Watermarking
and Embedded Signal Approaches</h3>
<p>Offer alternatives to metric-based and model-based limitations by
embedding detectable signals directly within LLM outputs.</p>
<p><strong>Soft Watermarking:</strong> - Introduced by Kirchenbauer et
al. - Biases language model to select from specific token subsets during
generation - Creates detectable statistical patterns in output -
<strong>Vulnerability</strong>: Susceptible to paraphrasing - small
wording changes disrupt token patterns</p>
<p><strong>Retrieval-Based Detection:</strong> - Stores generated text
in databases for future comparison - Uses similarity searches to
identify underlying similarities - Less vulnerable to paraphrasing than
token-based methods - <strong>Privacy Concerns</strong>: Requires
storing large amounts of user-generated content</p>
<h3 id="additional-challenges">4.4 Additional Challenges</h3>
<h4 id="adversarial-attacks">Adversarial Attacks</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Spoofing</strong>: Attackers craft human-written text
mimicking AI-generated statistical patterns, causing false
positives</li>

biases generate content tailored to specific personas, bypassing
detection methods</li>
</ul>

malicious instructions within input prompts, hijacking intended
functions</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="defense-mechanisms">Defense Mechanisms</h3>

relying on LLM self-examination - Involves querying LLM about
harmfulness of its own generated text - Demonstrates significant promise
in reducing attack success rates</p>
